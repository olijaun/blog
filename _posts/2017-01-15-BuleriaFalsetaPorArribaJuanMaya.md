In my [previous post]({% post_url 2017-01-07-FalsetaRecycling %}) I wrote that Buleria Falsetas "por arriba" (in the position of E phrygian) are less common than "por medio" (A phrygian) and how you can create your "own" Buleria falsetas recycling Solea falsetas.

So here is now a "real" Buleria "por arriba" falseta by Juan Maya that I found on Youtube. The falseta is played in the beginning of the recording from 00:14 to 00:30. Give it a listen!

I like it because it is technically "simple" (well, it is not if you play it as fast as Juan) and rhythmically interesting. I think that "old-style" falsetas are great because many modern falsetas are based those old ones.

Note that the falseta is written in 6/4 and the first beat is beat 12 in buleria compas. Because there is a quarter break first it actually starts on beat one which is common in old style buleria falsetas. Modern buleria falsetas often alreay start on the 12th beat.
