When I first went to a reunion of the bernese Flamenco Aficianados I had no idea how to accompany a singer. I was just amazed seeing other guitar players and how they somehow knew what to do and this albeit they have not practices the songs before. So how does flamenco accompaniment work? This article tries to shed some light on this mistery.

So what qualifies me to write about such a difficult topic? I'm an Aficionado and a moderate guitar player. My hope is to help with some observations that most professional guitar player usually will not tell you. And that is not because they do not know or they do not want to tell you. The point is that flamenco is still passed by word of mouth and many guitar player do not speak in terms of common music theory. They learned to play flamenco by observing other players I they simply "know" how it must be played and they grew up listening to flamenco all the time.

Living in Switzerland I did not have this privilege. I got interested in music by listening to The Beatles (well not swiss neither actually...). Later on I discovered Jazz and finally Flamenco. So I will first try to show how Flamenco accompaniment is different from Pop, Rock and Jazz.

## A Word About Rumba and Sevillanas
The following observations mainly concern 'real' flamenco like Sola, Buleria, Alegira, Tango etc. Palos (Styles) like Rumba or Sevillanas are more similar to Pop, Rock or Jazz because they have a (more or less) fixed structure. Styles like Solea let the singer more freedom and therefore it is more difficult for a guitar player to accompany.

## Flamenco Palos compared to Blues
The term 'Blues' does not specify a specific Blues song like Muddy Water's 'Baby Please Don't Go'. 'Blues' is a musical genre and so is e.g. 'Solea'. 'Buleria' is another musicale genre and so is 'Alegrias' etc.

'Blues' is usually associated with 12 bars and three chords. The classic blue scheme is like this:

```
4/4
| C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
```
There are chord variations like:

```
4/4
| C7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | G7 | 
```

An then there are variations with 16 bars instead of 12 like Herbie Hancock's 'Watermelon Man'.

```
4/4
| C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | G7 | F7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
```

An there are Minor Blues:

```
4/4
| Cm7   | Cm7  | Cm7 | Cm7 | 
| Fm7   | Fm7  | Cm7 | Cm7 | 
| Dm7b5 | G7b9 | Cm7 | Cm7 | 
```

Everyone would agree that these are all blues progressions.

A Flamenco Tango accompaniment could look like this:

```
4/4
| Bb | A7 | Bb | A7 |
| A7 | Dm | Dm | C7 | 
| C7 | F7 | Bb | A7 | 
```

This would go with the following letra (lyrics): 


```
  Bb      A7      Bb          A7
Triana Triana que bonita esta Triana
    A7          Dm
que bonita esta Triana 

C7                 F7              
cuando le ponen al puente
    Bb         A7
las banderitas gitanas
```

This a very famous letra. But there are many other different letras that can have a different accompaniment and it is still a Tango.

There are different things to understand here that apply to most flamenco palos like Buleria, Alegria etc:

### Different Song Concept

Assuming that the above is the first verse of a Tango. It is important to not that the following verses do  not have to follow the same chord progression. This is different e.g. to Pop or Jazz where you usually have multiple verses that use the same progression. Take again Muddy Water's 'Baby Please don't go'. The first two verses are like this:

```
1. verse
Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go 
Baby, please don't go
Down to New Orleans, you know I love you so

2. verse
Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
Before I be your dog 
I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone
```

There are four more verses and they all use the same chord progression. In flamenco this is different. People talk about 'letras' (Song texts) and one Letra could be the above example. So when you are in a fiesta accompanying a singer he might choose this letra as the first one. After this letra you do not know what will follow. He will choose any other letra and it is not predefined what will follow after each letra.

It is very important to note that we are talking about 'spontanous' Flamenco that is played at a fiesta and not about Flamenco in a Concert. In a concert very often almost everything is predefined and rehearsed.

So when you are in a fiesta the singer will not tell you 'let's play Song X'. Instead he would say 'let's play tangos'. This is like saying 'let's play blues' and then he starts to sing and you have to find out which blues he sings and accompany him correctly.

### Letras and chord progressions are not necessarily linked
Another important difference is that a letra is not necessarily linked to a specific chord progression. Let's look again at the above Triana-Letra. This Letra could be accompanied the following way:

```
  Bb      A7      Bb          A7
Triana Triana que bonita esta Triana
    A7          E7
que bonita esta Triana 

C7                 F7              
cuando le ponen al puente
    Bb         A7
las banderitas gitanas
```

Note the E7 chord that replaced the Dm chord in the previous example. Is it a substitution? No not really... Dm has not to do a lot with E7, has it? So why can we use it? The point is, that you have to choose the correct chord according to the singer! When you accompany a singer you cannot just play along because you know the song. You always have to listen and react to the singer. This makes it very difficult to accomany flamenco compared to e.g. a Blues song.

The singer also has the possibility to spontanously repeat parts. In the Triana example e.g. the last part 'cuando le ponen al puente las banderitas gitanas' could be repeated. So in this case you have to note that and also repeat the chords. The singer could also repeat the part 'que bonita esta Triana' and he would also change the melody a bit the second time so will be able to stay on E7.

### Making breaks
And there is a last thing to note: The singer might extend the length of some parts and make breaks. He could e.g. make a break of one measure after the Triana part on E7, or even three measures or whatever he likes...

### Substitutions
One thing that your are probably more familiar with are substitutions of chords. Modern flamenco player make heavy use of it and they use very advanced chords. This makes it very hard to analyse songs and to see the basic structure in accompaniment. When you try to analyze different palos I think it's best to listen to older records and guitar players that do not tend to play too much. I can recommend very much recordings by Camaron and Tomatito (e.g the ones from Paris). You can hear the guitar clearly and although Tomatito also uses some modern chords sometimes he mostly sticks to basic chords and you can learn a lot by trying to play along.

Let's look at a substitution example. In flamenco guitar player usually make heavy use of subdominant chords. In flamenco there is the typical andalusian cadence:


```
| Am | G7 | F7 | E |
```

This could be enriched with the following:

```
| Am D7 | G7 C7 | F7  | E |
```

I am certainly not the right person to explain you subdominants but there are plenty of explanations you can google. But you get the general idea. In the Triana-example you could do the following:

```
  Bb      A7      Bb          A7
Triana Triana que bonita esta Triana
    A7          Dm G7
que bonita esta Triana 

C7                 F7              
cuando le ponen al puente
    Gm7 Gm7/Ab     A7
las banderitas gitanas
```

First we use a G7 to pass from Dm to C7. In the end we use a Gm7 instead of Bb. Gm7 is basically a Bb with a G in the bass. And then we go to Gm7/Ab which is basically a Bb7 chord with the 7th in the base! This is probably a bit more advances but it is an extremely common substitution in flamenco. So if you hear this chord you know that is would have been played by an old school guitar player probably simply as Bb. 

## Summary
This was my short introduction to accompanying a flamenco singer. If you are used to play Jazz or Blues then these concepts might seem very strange firstly and something inside you tries to fight against it and you want your 12- or 16 bars cycles back. But when you are getting accustomed to it your will stop worrying and start loving spontaneous flamenco.

Where to go from here?

1. Listen to a lot of Flamenco (singing (cante) and not solo guitar!)
2. Try to play a long with some Camaron/Tomatito stuff
3. Search a singer
4. Play with singers
5. Play with singers

Further: If you have a specific questions then go ask them at www.foroflamenco.com. There are some very competent guys there that know a lot more than I do. The problem is usually to find the information but it is really a great resource.
