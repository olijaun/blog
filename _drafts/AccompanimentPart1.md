When I first went to a reunion of the bernese Flamenco Aficianados I had no idea how to accompany a singer. I was just amazed seeing other guitar players and how they somehow knew what to do and this albeit they have not practices the songs before. So how does flamenco accompaniment work? This article tries to shed some light on this mistery.

So what qualifies me to write about such a difficult topic? I'm an Aficionado and a moderate guitar player. My hope is to help with some observations that most professional guitar player usually will not tell you. And that is not because they do not know or they do not want to tell you. The point is that flamenco is still passed by word of mouth and many guitar player do not speak in terms of common music theory. They learned to play flamenco by observing other players I they simply "know" how it must be played and they grew up listening to flamenco all the time.

Living in Switzerland I did not have this privilege. I got interested in music by listening to The Beatles (well not swiss neither actually...). Later on I discovered Jazz and finally Flamenco. So I will first try to show how Flamenco accompaniment is different from Pop, Rock and Jazz.

## A Word About Rumba and Sevillanas
The following observations mainly concern 'real' flamenco like Sola, Buleria, Alegira, Tango etc. Palos (Styles) like Rumba or Sevillanas are more similar to Pop, Rock or Jazz because they have a (more or less) fixed structure. Styles like Solea let the singer more freedom and therefore it is more difficult for a guitar player to accompany.

## Flamenco Palos compared to Blues
The term 'Blues' does not specify a specific Blues song like Muddy Water's 'Baby Please Don't Go'. 'Blues' is a musical genre and so is e.g. 'Solea'. 'Buleria' is another musicale genre and so is 'Alegira' etc.

'Blues' is usually associated with 12 bars and three chords. The classic blue scheme is like this:

```
4/4
| C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
```
There are chord variations like:

```
4/4
| C7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | G7 | 
```

An then there are variations with 16 bars instead of 12 like Herbie Hancock's 'Watermelon Man'.

```
4/4
| C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 | 
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 | 
| G7 | F7 | G7 | F7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
```

Everyone would agree that these are all blues songs.

Now in case of Flamenco and e.g. 'Solea' as an example, they case is a bit different. The musical genre 'Solea' gives you even more possibilities. First look at an example Solea accompaniment:

```
3/4
| E        | E       | E       | Am      | 
| Am G7 F  | F       | F  F  E | E      | 
| G7 | F7 | G7 | F7 | 
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
```
